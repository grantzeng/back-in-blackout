/*
    Interface that represent the type a network node is. 
    - Conceptually I don't really see much difference between satellites and devices and
    attempting to use implementation inheritance just causes endless suffering. It is just
    an irrational and arbitrary decision whether something is a satellite or a device
    so rather than making them separate types it would be better to just capture 
    this in the interface
