# I'm not sure what to do that would improve the design? 

Let's just checklist all the functionality my design has to implement and have a look at my current design to see whether it's fit for purpose. 

> Objective is to "improve" the design, but I'm not wholly sure what this actually means. 

## First two behaviours (This is "easy" because it isn't a cross cutting concern and the natural solution to this problem works)
### Movement
Data involved
- position: Angle
- height: int
- linearVelocity: double

> position, height get updated each tick, using linearVelocity

Behaviours
- Devices don't move (but design needs to be amenable to extension)
- Satellite has circular orbit
- Relay satellite has its own special orbit
- Teleporting satellite has its own special orbit

Cross cutting concerns: 
- When a teleporting satellite teleports: 
    - satellite -> device or satellite -> satellite: file completely transfers to dest, but with all 't' bytes removed
    - device -> satellite: download fails, partial file has to be removed from dest file, and the source file is corrupted ( all 't' bytes removed)


### File management
Data involved/constraints 
- maximum files 
- maximum bytes
- file objects 

Constraints
- Devices can store an infinite number of files
- Relay satellites cannot store files
- Standard satellites only store max 3 file or 80 bytes (whichever is smaller)
- Teleporting satellites only store max 200 bytes, no file count constraints


Behaviours: 
- add complete file to a device (only available to devices)
- add empty file "allocate memory" for transmission on client (devices and satellites)


> Basically, responsibility of whatever is the file store to maintain these constraints



## File transmission (this is hard because it is a cross cutting concern: it involves multiple nodes)
Data involved
- max sending bandwidth
- max receiving bandwidth
- current uploads
- current downloads
- source file
- destination file 

### Transmission only registered if
- entities are of communicable types. The compatibility graph is:
    - StandardSatellite: `HandheldDevice`, `LaptopDevice`, `StandardSatellite`, `RelaySatellite`, `TeleportingSatellite` (i.e. all devices except `DesktopDevice` and all satellites)
    - RelaySatellite: `HandheldDevice`, `LaptopDevice`, `DesktopDevice`, `StandardSatellite`, `RelaySatellite`, `TeleportingSatellite` (i.e. all devices and satellites)
    - TeleportingSatellite:`HandheldDevice`, `LaptopDevice`, `DesktopDevice`, `StandardSatellite`, `RelaySatellite`, `TeleportingSatellite` (i.e. all devices and satellites)
    - DesktopDevice : `RelaySatellite`, `TeleportingSatellite` (all satellites except StandardSatellite)
    - `HandheldDevice`: all satellites only
    - `LaptopDevice`: all satellites only
    
- both client and server have resources
    - exists source file
    - exists uploading bandwidth
    - exists downloading bandwidth
    - file is not already downloaded on client
    - file is not a partial download on client
    - allocating space on client does not violate server constraints

- (spec says guranteed entities both in range)


### Transmission only occurs in a tick if

- the two parent entities are in range

> move all entities first

> number of bytes transferrable > 1 because not allowed to add a connection where it would result in no bandwidth


### Transmission characteristics: 
- the number of bytes transferred is `min(sending bandwidth, receiving bandwidth)` i.e. bottleneck by whichver is lower

> Bandwidth is floored division of `max/current connections` and calculated at each tick


### When transmission closes
- if client is out of range of server.
    - partial file needs to be removed from client
    - connection references need to be closed

- if file has finished transmitting
    - file on client needs to be marked as completed
    - connection references need to be removed
    
### Cross cutting concern involving teleporting satellites
- if situation involves a teleporting satellite and the satellite teleports

    - satellite -> device or satellite -> satellite. client gets rest of file with all 't' bytes removed and file is marked as complete
    - device -> satellite: 
        - partial file is removed from dest file
        - source file is corrupted (all 't' bytes removed)
        - close connection 




### Adding/removing entities from the system
- `createDevice`
- `removeDevice`  (I think ideally should remove all donwloads?)
- `createSatellite`
- `removeSatellite`
- `listAllDeviceIds`
- `listAllSatelliteIds`
- `addFileToDevice`
- `getInfo`: basically get info about entitiy's files etc.
- `sendFile`: register a transmission 
- `simulate`: moves all objects, gets transmission to tick over
