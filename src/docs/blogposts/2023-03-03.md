# Figuring out Task 2c. 

My current "design"...well, I can probably force it to work. But 
(a) it's not very elegant
(b) I'm not likely to learn anything useful by doing that. 

I did have a better idea on Wednesday evening which was: 
- We should just have some kind of CRUD interface

I'm also thinking: 
- Two layered "architecture" 
    - Servers do file storage and transmission and the ticking over. 
    - but we have the NetworkNodes deal with motion, things going in and out of range etc.
        - and they transmit this information to server objects as needed
        

## Trying a different kind of UML 
Let's design an interface. 
```java
interface CRUDBasic
- create(String filename, int size); // Try to create empty file 
- write(String filename, char byte, Mode mode); // Try to write to a resource 
- read(String filename, int position); // Try to read a reasource 

enum Mode {
    APPEND 
    TRUNCATE 
}
```
Yeah it seems like...files only really get created and updated. The only exception is that partially completed files get garbage collected if "sender goes out of range". 

Regarding the dependency inversion principle, I think maybe I can deal with the frustratingly stupid behaviour of the `TeleportingSatellite` with a separate interface?


## Mapping out the code flow

This is still sort of thinking procedurally. 

### Thinking carefully about how to _set up_ the transmission 

```java
