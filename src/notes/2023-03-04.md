Items: 
- Happy with the current sent up of `NetworkNode` -- apparently I've actually converged onto a tempalate pattern. 
- "Coupling" isn't simply objects having references to other objects. It's whether the functional units of your code are so intertwined that it makes it difficult to modify one without modifying another. 
    - _Duck test for coupling_: 
        - Does this structure make it _hard_ to modify this component without having to modify other components?
        - If a class is constantly probing another class for data...suggests coupling. 
        
- _How big is too big for a class?_ After discussion with tutor, no point in splitting off a class "just because"...the real question is whether it's conceptually integral. 


# Things I need to do 
- Refactor out the sever object from the design
- Design the connection object and the transmission system
    - Need to do some careful datamodelling.
