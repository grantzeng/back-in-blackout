Reread the assignment and see if we can rearchitect the system to work the way we want it to. 

There's three things I'm trying to learn here: 
- How to architect a non-trivial piece of software. 
- How to put together a system that is a working version every step of the way
- Tests and the role of test writing. (This is a big question mark for me) 

The point is: there is this jump between writing a glorified script (which I can do), and being able to put together a software system. You need to start small. Start with something the size of a uni assignment. Start with a webapp. Read about these things. There's all this practical know-how you need to learn which you haven't but which you can't really learn except by doing it yourself. 

I'm not going to lie, I'm full of anxiety and fear about whether I can do it but you just need to be able to sit with this - and just do it to show to yourself you can do things.
